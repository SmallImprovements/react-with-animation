# Contribute

I'd love to see others suggest improvements. There's definitely room for improvement everywhere. Testing, documentation, coding, thinking about new features or refining existing features.

## Guidelines

Things that are important to me:

- Before creating a PR, make sure to write up an Issue

- Don't try make react-with-animation something else - it is not an animation library or "Animations with JS" 

## Further Feature Ideas

Just a collection of ideas, might happen but might also not happen:

- Allow for animations to play more than once (integrate `animation-iteration-count`)

Feel free to propose a feature in the Issues.
